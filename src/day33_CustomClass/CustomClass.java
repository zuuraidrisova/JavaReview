        Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

        Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects,
        along with its attributes and methods.
         For example: in real life, a car is an object.
         The car has attributes, such as weight and color,
         and methods, such as drive and brake.

    A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

        class is a template for objects
        and an object is an instance of a class.

    To create a class, use the keyword class:

    An object is created from a class,  use the keyword new to create an object of a class

    Instance variables, object variables = are all attributes of the class

    Another term for class attributes is fields.

    You can specify as many attributes as you want.
