    OOP ==> OBJECT- ORIENTED PROGRAMMING:

    OOP PRINCIPLES

    Encapsulation ==> hiding the data
    Inheritance
    Abstraction
    Polymorphism

    two steps to go in order to apply Encapsulation:

        1. by giving private access modifier
        2. granting access to other classes to use that private
                    data thru the getter adn setter


    getter(): public instance method, should always return data type,
                return type must match with instance variables data type
                read only
                returns private data

    setter(prmtr):public instance method
                return type is always void
                has parameter
                modify only
                initializes the argument to private instance variable
