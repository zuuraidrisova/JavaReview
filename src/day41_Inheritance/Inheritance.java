    Inheritance is building relationships between sub and super class

    In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.
     We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

    subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
    superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from

    To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.

    Why And When To Use "Inheritance"?
    - It is useful for code reusability:
    reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.
