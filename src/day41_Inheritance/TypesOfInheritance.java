        TYPES OF INHERITANCE:

        Single Inheritance :     subclass inherits the features of superclass

        Multi-Level Inheritance : subclass inherits super class, and then subclass becomes
                                    superclass for another subclass

                           grandparent -->   parent --> grandson

         Hierarchical Inheritance:  one super class can serve more than one sub class


        Visible Variables and methods can be inherited

        Constructor cannot be inherited, because constructor name must match with class name

        if  private variables and methods, they cannot be inherited directly
