     /*

    Type Castings:
            converting one type to another
            used to change type(ex: int to double)


    Primitive Type Casting:

         byte > short > int > long > float > double
          Two type:   explicit and implicit

            Explicit: larger to smaller, done manually
                    ex: int a = 200;
                        short s = (short)a;

            Implicit: smaller one to larger, done automatically
                    ex: int a = 100;
                        double b = a;

    Reference Type Casting:
            pre-condition:  must be IS A relationship, inheritance
            Two types: UpCasting and DownCasting

            UpCasting: casting from sub class to super class
                        done automatically, implicitly

            DownCasting: casting from super class type  to sub class type
                        done manually, explicitly
